# CRIME-O-MART
Code School Final Project


## About The Project
CRIME-O-MART is a game where users shop for crimes at the CRIME-O-MART crime store.
The users pick through aisles of crimes, consisting of Theft, Assault, Traffic, Drugs, and Clearance crimes.
While the user is on a crime aisle, they will choose random images â€“ selecting 10 images from whichever aisle they wish to browse.
The user is not aware of the crimes they have picked until they proceed to the checkout. At the checkout,
they will click through the images they have selected, revealing the crime they have chosen,
along with the fine and jail time required for committing that specific crime.

This application was built as a final project for a Code School summer program at Utah Tech University.
